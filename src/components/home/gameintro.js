        <h1>CHOOSE YOUR OWN PACE (FARM OR FIGHT!)</h1>
        <p>
          Use the cover of darkness to avoid PvP combat, build your resources
          and focus on PvE takedowns to scavenge the best loot. In the safe
          settlement you can trade safely with other players, or save to your
          server-side stash. Alternatively, you can choose to tool up and raid
          as a lone wolf or teamed with buddies, dropping where you want in the
          8x8km world using regular helicopter insertions from the settlements
          or on foot. And all the while, lose just the equipment you brought
          with you in the event you meet an untimely death. <br /><br />
          <h3>DYNAMIC DAY / NIGHT</h3>
          / WEATHER The day and night cycle in XERA: Survival adds variation to
          game play. In darkness, it’s easier to avoid other players and
          scavenge the best loot. But beware, different robot variations come
          out at night – faster and harder to kill. Weigh up your choices
          carefully… A realistic weather system has been implemented which adds
          further dynamic elements to combat and survival. Your tactics will
          need to change depending on the weather conditions.
